Object drills

1. Object initializers and methods

Create an object called loaf using an object initializer ({}) with two properties: flour, which should be set to 300 and water which should be set to 210.
Use console.log to print the flour and water properties.
Add an empty method to the loaf object called hydration.
Fill in the body of the method to return the hydration of the loaf (the water divided by the flour multiplied by 100).
Call the hydration method and use console.log to print the result.

*/

let loaf = {

    flour: 300,

    water: 210,

    hydration () {

        return ( loaf.water / loaf.flour ) * 100;

    }

};

console.log ( loaf.flour, loaf.water );

console.log ( loaf.hydration() );

/*
2. Iterating over an object's properties

Create an object with five properties: foo, bar, fum, quux, and spam. Give each property a unique value of your choosing.
Loop over the object using for ... in
Use console.log to show each property name and its associated value.

*/

let obj = {
    foo: "boo",
    bar: "keep",
    fum: "fie",
    quux: "suux",
    spam: "breakfast"
};

for (let x in obj) {
    console.log(x, obj[x]);
};


/*

3. Arrays in objects
Create an object with a property called meals which is an array of strings: 'breakfast', 'second breakfast', 'elevenses', 'lunch', 'afternoon tea', 'dinner', 'supper'.
Use console.log to show the name of a hobbit's fourth meal of the day.
Don't forget that humans and hobbits count from 1, but computers count from 0.

*/

let someObj = {

    meals: [ 'breakfast', 'second breakfast', 'elevenses', 'lunch', 'afternoon tea', 'dinner', 'supper' ]
};

console.log ( someObj.meals [ 3 ] );
