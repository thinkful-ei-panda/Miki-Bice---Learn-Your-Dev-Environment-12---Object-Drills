Object drills

1. Object initializers and methods

Create an object called loaf using an object initializer ({}) with two properties: flour, which should be set to 300 and water which should be set to 210.
Use console.log to print the flour and water properties.
Add an empty method to the loaf object called hydration.
Fill in the body of the method to return the hydration of the loaf (the water divided by the flour multiplied by 100).
Call the hydration method and use console.log to print the result.

let loaf = {

    flour: 300,

    water: 210,

    hydration () {

        return ( loaf.water / loaf.flour ) * 100;

    }

};

console.log ( loaf.flour, loaf.water );

console.log ( loaf.hydration() );
